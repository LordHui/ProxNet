This is the Matlab simulation that studies the equivalence between dropout and ProxNet.

The main file is main.m.  

No installation is needed (other than Matlab itself).

Usage:

\lambda and \mu can be set to a range in line 16 and 17 of main.m.
c = factor*lambda^2/2*mu (by the last equation on page 4)
So users can set the value of 'factor' in line 20 of main.m

Output:
Plots like Figure 6 in Appendix B.
